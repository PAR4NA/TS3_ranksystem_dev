- server creation date is for the most server by 0.. wrong php code or empty callback from teamspeak?
- git: check boost for different person on same group with different beginning time.. bug is they ends all with same time

IDEAS
* Information when new TeamSpeak Server Version available (inform as server message or perhaps on site)
* Inform TeamSpeak User about new Client version as Message on Site (= Release Version > Client Version)
* Special Servergroup for User of the Week and or user of the Month
* Enable Text-Message on TeamSpeak for Bot; User can write to the Bot for example !nextup and get then their needed time for next rankup
